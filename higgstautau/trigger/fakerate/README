The FR have been estimated by Julian. There is no package, but I
attach his code.
What you need to do is:

#include "FakeRateScaler.h"

...

FakeRateScaleFactor::FakeRateScaler* my_FRScaler = new
FakeRateScaleFactor::FakeRateScaler();

double fakeRateScaleFactor =
my_FRScaler->getScaleFactor(tau_pt,"Tight","EF_tau29T_medium1");

you need to apply these SF on top of ID+trigger

cheers
