This tool gives you SF and error. You can also use this tool to parametrize
the trigger eff in the embedded sample


Zinonas:

for single tau distributions , such as the tau pT, you obviously need to apply
the SF for single taus. That means that we should know exactly which offline
tau is matched to which trigger tau of the EF_tau29_tau20 trigger, in order
to request the proper EF single tau trigger factor. How to you do that?

Daniele:

Then things get more difficult!
First you need to get the RoI of the trigger taus, that means that for
the tight trigger on MC you need to get the RoI using Will's tool for
emulation. Then you match the selected trigger taus with the offline
taus and then you can see which trigger tau has the EF pt higher than
29 GeV. If both are above 29 then you apply the SF for tau29 to the
leading tau only.
