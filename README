Installation:
=============

You need to install these packages:

    * rootpy  (https://github.com/rootpy/rootpy)
    * atlastools (https://github.com/ndawe/atlastools)
    * goodruns (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/goodruns/2.0)

Download each package with:

    git clone git://github.com/ndawe/${packagename}.git

--OR--

    svn checkout http://svn.github.com/ndawe/${packagename}.git ${packagename}

then follow the README in each package to install them
(use the --user option after setup.py)

i.e.

    cd rootpy
    python setup.py install --user
    cd ..

    cd atlastools
    python setup.py install --user
    cd ..

    cd goodruns
    python setup.py install --user
    cd ..

and be sure to use at least Python version 2.6 (2.7 is preferred).
DO NOT PLACE THESE PACKAGES IN THIS DIRECTORY! Put them somewhere else,
such as ~/python-modules or where you keep your python package sources.

Now build the C extension module for jet cleaning in the higgstautau package:

    cd higgstautau/jetcleaning
    ./setup.py build_ext --inplace 


Skimming on the Grid:
=====================

First add any new dataset containers to datasets.cfg or to the relevant file in
datasets/*.txt Then run this, for example:


    grid-submit -s HHSkim.py -u NoelDawe -m datasets.cfg mc11

Which will submit skimming jobs on all input containers not yet skimmed under
the section mc11 in datasets.cfg. To create a new production use the option -v 2 etc.
and output dataset names will end with .v2
