more details to come later...

basic instructions:

install atlastools:

    git clone git://github.com/ndawe/atlastools.git

or if you insist on using an inferior VCS such as Subversion:
    
    svn checkout http://svn.github.com/ndawe/atlastools.git

Follow the README in atlastools for installation instructions

If you also want to test the code locally then you will need to install rootpy and goodruns.
Same procedure as above, just use these urls:

    git://github.com/ndawe/rootpy.git or http://svn.github.com/ndawe/rootpy.git

    git://github.com/ndawe/goodruns.git or http://svn.github.com/ndawe/goodruns.git

and be sure to use at least Python version 2.6 (2.7 is preferred).
These additional packages (alond with Python 2.7 and ROOT 5.30) are downloaded and installed automatically on the grid
in the setup.sh script.

Make sure you have pandatools setup and run (replace NoelDawe with your grid name and set --version to whatever you want):

    grid-submit -m htau_datasets.yml -s HTauProcessor -u NoelDawe --version 34 --extFile JERProviderPlots.root VBF*

This will run on all datasets in htau_datasets.yml matching VBF*. Replace VBF* with or append "data" to also run on data.
The main code which runs on the grid is HTauProcessor.py
