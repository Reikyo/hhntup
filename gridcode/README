more details to come later...

basic instructions:

install atlastools:

    git clone git://github.com/ndawe/atlastools.git

or if you insist on using an inferior VCS such as Subversion:
    
    svn checkout http://svn.github.com/ndawe/atlastools.git atlastools

Follow the README in atlastools for installation instructions

You also need PyYAML:

    easy_install --user pyyaml

If you also want to test the code locally then you will need to install rootpy and goodruns.
Same procedure as above, just use these urls:

    git://github.com/ndawe/rootpy.git or http://svn.github.com/ndawe/rootpy.git

    git://github.com/ndawe/goodruns.git or http://svn.github.com/ndawe/goodruns.git

and be sure to use at least Python version 2.6 (2.7 is preferred).
These additional packages (along with Python 2.7 and ROOT 5.30) are downloaded and installed automatically on the grid
in the setup.sh script.

Download required packages that will be sent to the grid (rather than downloaded by the grid nodes since some don't allow this):

    ./setup.sh local

Make sure you have pandatools setup and run this (replace NoelDawe with your grid name and set --version to whatever you want):

    grid-submit -m datasets.yml -s HTauProcessor -u NoelDawe --version 34 --extFile JERProviderPlots.root VBF*

This will run on all datasets in datasets.yml matching VBF*. Replace VBF* with or append "data" to also run on data, etc.
You may also append arguments understood by prun (i.e. --nFilesPerJob 8) at the end of the command above and they will be passes along to prun.
The main code which runs on the grid is HTauProcessor.py. Event filters are defined in filters.py.
