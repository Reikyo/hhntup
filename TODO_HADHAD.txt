remove track branches
reduce skim size
use "all good" GRL
check scale factor default values (should be 1)
- apply the new tau recommendations
- think about dropping the tau_tracks_* variables (the recounted trks are already stored in the skim)
- skim instead of the 2 taus BDT_loose OR LLH_loose, only BDT_loose. The OR was meant to get stats, but now we should have plenty and we prefer to not mix BDT and LLH
- do the full MC skim without trigger
- Only apply eveto on 1p taus:
