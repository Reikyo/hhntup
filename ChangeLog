	* Migrating from atlasoff to atlasgrp

	* Patched up the overlap removal order, to correct the muon and tau overlaps

2012-04-02 Michel Trottier-McDonald <mtm@cern.ch>
	* Migration to the ATLAS HSG4 SVN
	* Setting tauBDTJetScore back to medium in preselection
	* Adding MET in the Processor files
	* Fixed the histogram matching bins
	* Now requiring pt>18GeV for matched EFMG object, although that isn't quite enough
	* Putting back the trig_* block in the skim: I need it for muon trigger matching
	* Adding the electron triggers into the MC D3PD skims
	* Removing the tau_OtherTrk_* block from the D3PD skims

2012-03-06 Michel Trottier-McDonald <mtm@cern.ch>
	* Adding muLHProcessor.py : Event quality and object selection
	* Adding higgstautau/lephad/models.py
	* Adding test-lhskim.sh

2012-02-23 Michel Trottier-McDonald <mtm@cern.ch>
	* Adding muLHSkim.py: Skimming, trimming and object preselection for mu-had channel
	* Adding higgstautau/lephad/filters.py: Define muTriggers muMCTriggers
	* Adding this ChangeLog
	* Adding datasets/lephad/*.txt: Specify datasets for mu-had channel
	* Modify datasets.cfg: Adding data11 and mc11c datasets for mu-had channel
