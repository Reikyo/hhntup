:Abstract: A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the di-tau decay
			  channel with fully hadronic tau decays is presented based on 4.7 fb
			  :sup:`−1` of integrated luminosity recorded by the ATLAS detector in
			  pp collisions from the LHC at :math:`\sqrt{s}` = 7 TeV. The search
			  covers Higgs boson mass hypotheses of :math:`100 \leq m_H \leq 150`
			  GeV. Boosted decision trees are trained to distinguish Higgs signal
			  from background.  No significant excess was found in the mass range
			  of this study.  Upper limits at 95% C.L. on the SM production cross
			  section were set and found to be ∼ X times the SM Higgs boson
			  production cross section in the most sensitive range of :math:`X \leq
			  m_H \leq Y` GeV.
